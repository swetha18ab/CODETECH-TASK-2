TASK 2
Implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like
square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the
Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluation.
### Description

Predicting Boston home prices using linear algorithms involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and other relevant characteristics. Linear algorithms, such as Linear Regression, are often used for this task due to their simplicity and interpretability.

### Objectives

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gather the Boston Housing dataset, which includes various features like crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and distance to employment centers.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering:**
   - Identify and select the most relevant features that influence house prices.
   - Create new features that could improve model performance based on domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Choose a linear algorithm for the model, primarily Linear Regression.
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the model’s performance.

4. **Model Evaluation and Validation:**
   - Use evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the model’s accuracy.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure the model’s robustness and generalizability.

5. **Implementation and Interpretation:**
   - Implement the trained model to predict house prices on new, unseen data.
   - Interpret the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the house prices.

### Example Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Utilize the Boston Housing dataset, which contains features such as per capita crime rate, proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft., and average number of rooms per dwelling.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Normalize features like the number of rooms or crime rate to ensure they are on a similar scale.
   - Encode categorical features such as the zoning classification.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Use techniques like correlation analysis and domain knowledge to select important features.
   - Engineer new features, such as interaction terms between existing features, that might improve model performance.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train a Linear Regression model using the selected features.
   - Evaluate the model on a validation set and fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Calculate evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, R-squared.
   - Use residual plots to diagnose potential issues like heteroscedasticity or non-linearity.

6. **Implementation:**
   - Apply the model to predict prices for new homes.
   - Interpret model coefficients to provide insights into the influence of different features on home prices.

By following these objectives, a linear algorithm can be effectively used to predict Boston home prices, providing accurate estimates and valuable insights into the factors affecting real estate values.
